## Read this if you are writing code for T@NYU
To compile React code, we use webpack, babel, es2015, and hot-reload (amongst other fancy, new JS libraries). We use Redux to manage the states in a global store.


If you have no experience with React, go do the Facebook React [Get Started](https://facebook.github.io/react) guide and come back when you do.


If you have some experience with React but not with Redux, then go watch Dan Abramov's (creator of Redux) Redux videos on Egghead.io. There's ~10 of them and each is like 2 minutes long. You will be glad that you did.


I also strongly suggest you to go read Airbnb's [React guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) section on stateless vs. stateful components. 



In this repo:
- Stateless components are in `/components`
- Stateful components are in `/containers`



## Suggestions for the future:
- refactor actions, reducers, and reducer constants into individual files
